4-function Calculator: (calculator.asm)

Sample interaction:
    Select operation (+, -, *, or /): -
    First number: 5
    Second number: 2
    answer = 3
    -- program terminated successfully --

First, read in the operator as a string.
Then call one of four functions, to add subtract, multiply or divide as appropriate.
Each function should read in two integers (possibly using a helper function) and then return the result of the calcuation.
The main function should then print out the answer and exit.
